# 📦 NPM Package Setup - Complete!

Your **broadcast-server-cli** package is now ready to be published to npm! 🎉

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Updated `package.json`
- Added comprehensive metadata (description, keywords, author, license)
- Configured the `bin` field to make `broadcast-server` a global command
- Added `files` field to specify what gets published
- Set up proper repository and homepage URLs
- Added Node.js engine requirement (>=14.0.0)

### 2. ✅ Created `.npmignore`
- Excludes development files, IDE configs, and OS files
- Keeps the published package clean and minimal

### 3. ✅ Updated `README.md`
- Added npm installation instructions
- Updated usage examples for both global and local installation
- Clear documentation for end users

### 4. ✅ Created `LICENSE`
- MIT License file (as specified in package.json)

### 5. ✅ Created Documentation
- **TESTING.md** - How to test the package locally before publishing
- **PUBLISHING.md** - Complete guide to publish on npm

## Next Steps

### Before Publishing

1. **Update Personal Information** in `package.json`:
   ```json
   "author": "Your Name <your.email@example.com>",
   "repository": {
     "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/broadcast-server.git"
   }
   ```

2. **Update the Copyright** in `LICENSE`:
   ```
   Copyright (c) 2026 [Your Name]
   ```

3. **Check Package Name Availability**:
   - The name `broadcast-server-cli` might be taken
   - Search on npmjs.com or run: `npm search broadcast-server-cli`
   - If taken, consider: `@yourusername/broadcast-server-cli` (scoped package)

### Testing Locally

The package is already linked globally! You can test it now:

```bash
# Start the server
broadcast-server start

# In another terminal, connect via CLI
broadcast-server connect ws://localhost:8080

# Or connect to your deployed server
broadcast-server connect wss://broadcastserver.onrender.com
```

### Publishing to npm

Follow the detailed guide in **PUBLISHING.md**:

1. Create an npm account at https://www.npmjs.com/signup
2. Login: `npm login`
3. Test locally: `npm link` (already done!)
4. Publish: `npm publish` (or `npm publish --access public` for scoped packages)
